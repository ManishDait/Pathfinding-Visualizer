# PathFinding Visualizer

This is a simple Angular project which help to visualize various Pathfinding Algorithms.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.


## Algorithm you can visualize

- Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.
- Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- Dijistras Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.
- More to be added.

## Building from source

```
```
ng build
```
